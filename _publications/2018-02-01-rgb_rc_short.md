excerpt: 'This work extends the red giant evolutionary state convolutional network towards *K2*- and *TESS*-like datasets, showing that high levels of accuracy can still being achieved for shorter observational data.  The evolutionary states of around 15,000 *Kepler* red giants are additionally classified, doubling the number of red giants that given this analysis.'
