We present the discovery that the close-in planet Halla (8 UMi b) orbits a core-helium burning star and should have been engulfed by its host star previously. This is the first confirmation that core-helium burning giants can host close-in planets, and provides evidence for binarity for the existence of planets around 'forbidden' systems.
