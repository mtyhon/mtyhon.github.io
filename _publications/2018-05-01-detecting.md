excerpt: 'For the first time, we use deep learning-based computer vision to mimic the human visual ability in detecting solar-like oscillations in images of red giants power spectra. Thousands of stars can be analyzed in seconds with a human expert-level ability, making this method into an extremely powerful tool in the era of Big Data in asteroseismology.'

For the first time, we use deep learning-based computer vision to mimic the human eye's ability in detecting solar-like oscillations in red giants. Thousands of stars can be analyzed in seconds with a human expert-level prowess, making this method into an extremely powerful tool in the era of Big Data in asteroseismology.
