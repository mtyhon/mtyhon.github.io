excerpt: 'The asteroseismic modelling of evolved solar-like stars is a complex, high-dimensional optimization problem. Here, we introduce deep learning as a novel, computationally-feasible method to identify good matching models to observed subgiants from the *Kepler* mission.'

Using machine learning, we take a look at detecting red giants across the sky across TESS's first two years. With only one month of TESS observations, we detect the largest sample of oscillating stars across the sky to date, opening up prospects for all-sky studies of stellar populations.
