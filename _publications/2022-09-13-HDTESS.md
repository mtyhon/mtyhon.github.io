excerpt: 'The asteroseismic modelling of evolved solar-like stars is a complex, high-dimensional optimization problem. Here, we introduce deep learning as a novel, computationally-feasible method to identify good matching models to observed subgiants from the *Kepler* mission.'

We publish a catalog of masses and radii for approximately 1,700 stars near the ecliptic poles (or TESS's Continuous Viewing Zones). These stars are among the best and brightest observed by TESS, and include many very interesting, well-studied red giants.
