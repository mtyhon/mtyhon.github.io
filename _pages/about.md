Astronomer, Explorer, and Tinkerer
======
I am an [assistant professor](https://www.physics.nus.edu.sg/faculty/marc-hon/) in the Department of Physics at the National University of Singapore. Previously, I was a [postdoctoral researcher](https://space.mit.edu/people/marc-hon/) at the [TESS Science Office](https://tess.mit.edu/) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a [2020 NASA Hubble Fellow](https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/fellowships/nasa-hubble-fellowship-program/2020-nhfp-fellows?fbclid=IwAR2BAuH-GNrXdjNEz7NGGZtm8Px7qh-lCTyiUYyvL1LA-FbdBRtwHApWpgA#section-d9c9b807-4923-4a97-892c-a971f90a2b55) at the Institute for Astronomy in Hawai'i. My focus is on data-driven studies of astrophysical time-domain data, including starlight from stars called _light curves_. Planet-hunting missions, such as NASA's [_Kepler_](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/main/index.html), NASA's [Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (_TESS_)](https://www.nasa.gov/tess-transiting-exoplanet-survey-satellite), and the European Space Agency's [_Gaia_](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Gaia) have truly catapulted us into the large survey-era of astronomy. More than ever, we need clever tools to assist us astronomers in making new discoveries and deepening our understanding of the Galaxy and cosmos from this deluge of data.
