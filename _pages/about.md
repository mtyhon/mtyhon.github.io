This is my personal webpage. It is still a work-in-progress as I learn how to tweak the design a bit.


Achievements

Actually exploring the [docs](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) on how to change some design on this page! I will be exploring this soon!


**Smaller Section Here**

More info that I really should be looking at
------
More info about configuring academicpages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
