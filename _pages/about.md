Biography
======
I am a PhD candidate in the School of Physics in UNSW Sydney working with [Dennis Stello](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/associate-professor-dennis-stello). My work focuses on the **applications of deep learning in asteroseismology**, which combines two very exciting research fields: artificial intelligence and astronomy. With great strides in recent exoplanet-hunting missions from NASA such as [_Kepler_](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/main/index.html) and the [Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (_TESS_)](https://www.nasa.gov/tess-transiting-exoplanet-survey-satellite), asteroseismology has become a key tool for the characterization of fundamental stellar properties of a star and to investigate stellar interiors. Using deep learning for asteroseismology accelerates this analysis for thousands to millions of stars, thus becoming important methods for Galactic archaeology and the search for exoplanets.
