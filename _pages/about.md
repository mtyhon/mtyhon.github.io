Biography
======
I am a [2020 NASA Hubble Fellow](https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/fellowships/nasa-hubble-fellowship-program/2020-nhfp-fellows?fbclid=IwAR2BAuH-GNrXdjNEz7NGGZtm8Px7qh-lCTyiUYyvL1LA-FbdBRtwHApWpgA#section-d9c9b807-4923-4a97-892c-a971f90a2b55) doing postdoctoral research at the Institute for Astronomy in Hawai'i. My research focuses on the asteroseismology of red giant stars, which has become a key tool for the characterization of stellar populations and Galactic archeology in the large survey-era of astronomy thanks to recent exoplanet-hunting missions from NASA such as [_Kepler_](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/main/index.html) as well as the [Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (_TESS_)](https://www.nasa.gov/tess-transiting-exoplanet-survey-satellite).

Much of my work is also devoted to the application of machine learning in astronomy. Such an endeavour combines two very exciting and fast-moving disciplines, with great potential for accelerating important discoveries that are beneficial for both stellar physics and Galactic archeology. Who knows what kind of new, exotic star we might find using our algorithms?

Research Interests
------
I am interested in understanding more about stellar evolution, as well as demystifying the origins of the Galaxy through modern space surveys! I am particularly keen on learning about new machine learning/data analysis techniques that I can apply to astronomy.

* Red Giant Asteroseismology
* Deep Learning and other approaches to Artificial Intelligence
* Machine Learning
* Galactic Archaeology


What Have I Been Up To?
------
I have recently published a paper cataloging asteroseismic masses, radii, and evolutionary states of over a thousand giants with beautiful oscillation spectra that were observed by TESS. The catalog is called HD-TESS, and it has been recently been accepted in The Astronomical Journal. I am also analyzing several very interesting bright giants, more on that soon!
